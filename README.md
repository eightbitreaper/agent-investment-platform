# Agent Investment Platform

This repository contains the code and documentation for building a private, agent-driven stock investment platform.  
The platform analyzes stock/ETF/bond trends, financial news, and external data sources to generate sentiment-driven insights and actionable recommendations.  

⚠️ **Note**: The system does not execute trades. It informs the operator so they can act manually.
