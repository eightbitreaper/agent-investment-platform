# Risk Management Framework Architecture

## Overview

The Risk Management Framework is a comprehensive system designed to provide institutional-grade risk controls for the Agent Investment Platform. It integrates seamlessly with the existing backtesting framework to provide position sizing, stop-loss management, portfolio risk monitoring, and dynamic risk adjustment capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. Risk Engine (`src/risk_management/risk_engine.py`)

**Purpose**: Central risk calculation and position sizing engine

**Key Features**:
- **Position Sizing Algorithms**:
  - Kelly Criterion: Optimal position sizing based on win/loss probability
  - Risk Parity: Equal risk contribution across positions
  - Volatility-based: Position sizing inversely proportional to volatility
  - Fixed Fractional: Fixed percentage of portfolio per position
  - Maximum Drawdown: Position sizing to limit maximum portfolio drawdown

- **Portfolio Risk Metrics**:
  - Value at Risk (VaR) at multiple confidence levels
  - Expected Shortfall (Conditional VaR)
  - Maximum Drawdown calculation and projection
  - Portfolio beta and correlation analysis
  - Sharpe ratio and risk-adjusted returns

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Real-time portfolio risk scoring (1-10 scale)
  - Sector and asset concentration analysis
  - Currency exposure risk (for international assets)
  - Liquidity risk assessment

### 2. Stop-Loss Manager (`src/risk_management/stop_loss_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Dynamic stop-loss and take-profit management

**Key Features**:
- **Stop-Loss Algorithms**:
  - ATR-based stops: Using Average True Range for volatility-adjusted stops
  - Percentage-based stops: Fixed percentage from entry price
  - Trailing stops: Dynamic stops that follow favorable price movement
  - Support/Resistance stops: Technical level-based stops
  - Time-based stops: Maximum holding period limits

- **Take-Profit Mechanisms**:
  - Risk-reward ratio targets (1:2, 1:3, custom ratios)
  - Fibonacci retracement levels
  - Moving average profit targets
  - Partial profit taking (scale-out strategies)

- **Dynamic Adjustment**:
  - Volatility-based stop adjustment
  - Market regime detection for stop modification
  - Correlation-based stop adjustments

### 3. Portfolio Monitor (`src/risk_management/portfolio_monitor.py`)

**Purpose**: Real-time portfolio risk monitoring and alerting

**Key Features**:
- **Risk Monitoring**:
  - Real-time portfolio VaR calculation
  - Drawdown monitoring and alerts
  - Concentration risk tracking
  - Correlation matrix monitoring
  - Sector/asset allocation drift detection

- **Alert Systems**:
  - Risk threshold breach notifications
  - Margin call warnings
  - High correlation alerts
  - Liquidity risk warnings
  - Market regime change detection

- **Reporting**:
  - Daily risk reports
  - Portfolio heat maps
  - Risk attribution analysis
  - Performance vs. risk benchmarking

### 4. Configuration Manager (`src/risk_management/config_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Flexible risk parameter management

**Key Features**:
- **Strategy-Specific Settings**:
  - Different risk parameters per strategy
  - Dynamic risk adjustment based on market conditions
  - User-defined risk profiles (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive)

- **Global Risk Controls**:
  - Maximum portfolio leverage
  - Sector concentration limits
  - Single position size limits
  - Daily loss limits

## Integration Architecture

### Backtesting Integration

```python
# Enhanced BacktestEngine with Risk Management
class BacktestEngine:
    def __init__(self, risk_manager: RiskEngine):
        self.risk_manager = risk_manager
        self.stop_loss_manager = StopLossManager()
        self.portfolio_monitor = PortfolioMonitor()

    def execute_trade(self, signal, portfolio):
        # 1. Calculate position size using risk management
        position_size = self.risk_manager.calculate_position_size(
            signal, portfolio, current_price
        )

        # 2. Set stop-loss and take-profit levels
        stop_loss, take_profit = self.stop_loss_manager.calculate_levels(
            signal, current_price, volatility
        )

        # 3. Check portfolio risk limits
        if self.portfolio_monitor.check_risk_limits(portfolio, new_position):
            # Execute trade with risk controls
            trade = Trade(
                symbol=signal.symbol,
                quantity=position_size,
                stop_loss=stop_loss,
                take_profit=take_profit
            )
            return self.execute_trade_with_risk_controls(trade)
        else:
            # Reject trade due to risk limits
            return None
```

### Risk Configuration System

**Configuration File**: `config/risk_management.yaml`

```yaml
# Global Risk Settings
global_risk:
  max_portfolio_risk: 0.02  # 2% daily VaR limit
  max_position_size: 0.05   # 5% max single position
  max_sector_concentration: 0.20  # 20% max per sector
  max_correlation: 0.7      # Maximum position correlation

# Position Sizing
position_sizing:
  default_method: "volatility_based"
  kelly_lookback: 252       # Days for Kelly calculation
  risk_parity_lookback: 60  # Days for risk parity
  max_kelly_fraction: 0.25  # Maximum Kelly position size

# Stop Loss Settings
stop_loss:
  default_method: "atr_based"

```

## Risk Metrics and Calculations

### 1. Position Sizing Algorithms

**Kelly Criterion**:
```
f* = (bp - q) / b
where:
- f* = fraction of capital to wager
- b = odds received on the wager
- p = probability of winning
- q = probability of losing (1 - p)
```

**Risk Parity**:
```
w_i = (1/σ_i) / Σ(1/σ_j)
where:
- w_i = weight of asset i
- σ_i = volatility of asset i
```

**Volatility-Based Sizing**:
```
position_size = target_risk / (price * volatility)
where:
- target_risk = desired dollar risk per position
- volatility = historical volatility of the asset
```

### 2. Risk Metrics

**Value at Risk (VaR)**:
```
VaR = -μ + σ * z_α
where:
- μ = expected return
- σ = portfolio standard deviation
- z_α = z-score at confidence level α
```

**Expected Shortfall (ES)**:
```
ES = E[X | X ≤ VaR]
Average loss beyond VaR threshold
```

**Maximum Drawdown**:
```
MDD = max(Peak - Trough) / Peak
Maximum peak-to-trough decline
```
