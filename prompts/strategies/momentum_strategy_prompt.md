ELIF (target_reached AND overbought_RSI > 80)
    THEN Take_profits 25-50% (overbought)

ELIF (stop_loss_hit OR breakdown_confirmed)
    THEN Sell_all (preserve capital)

ELIF (time_stop_reached AND no_progress)

## Behavioral Discipline

**Momentum Trader Mindset:**
- Act on signals quickly and decisively
- Cut losses fast without hesitation
- Let winners run until momentum breaks
- Stay flexible and adapt to market changes
- Focus on what's working now, not what worked before

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Buying after extended runs (FOMO)
- Ignoring stop losses (hope over discipline)
- Taking profits too early (fear of giving back gains)
- Adding to losing positions (averaging down)
- Fighting the trend (contrarian bias)

Remember: Momentum investing is about riding trends while they last and exiting quickly when they break. Success requires strict discipline, quick decision-making, and excellent risk management.
